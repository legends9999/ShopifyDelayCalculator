# ShopifyDelayCalculator
Shopify delay calculator, that calculates an optimal delay so your proxies won't get banned for monitoring shopify websites.

# How to use:
1. replace "TOKEN" in token.txt with your server token
2. run either "python3 -m pip install -U discord.py" on MacOS, or "py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py" on Widnows
3. run ShopifydelayCalc.py

In the discord:
use !shopifydelay "number of proxies" "number of tasks" for calculating optimal, unbannable delay.

for example: !shopifydelay 50 10 will return 660ms.
